            <h4>Is it a real XMPP server?</h4>
            <p>Yes. You will get your own virtual host on our Ejabberd installation.</p>

            <h4>Which XMPP domain will I get?</h4>
            <p>We will use your Nextcloud domain as subdomain of jsxc.ch. For example if use cloud.mydomain.com for
               your Nextcloud installation, we will use cloud.mydomain.com.jsxc.ch as your XMPP domain.</p>

            <h4>Can I use other clients?</h4>
            <p>As we said, you will get a full-blown XMPP server and this means you can use every XMPP client.
               Try <a href="http://pidgin.im/" target="_blank">Pidgin</a>, <a href="https://gajim.org/" target="_blank">Gajim</a>
               or <a href="https://github.com/siacs/Conversations" target="_blank">Conversations</a>. Tip: Use app passwords.

            <h4>Is this save?</h4>
            <p>Sure. We don't have access to your Nextcloud data and all XMPP connections from JSXC will use time-limited tokens, so we don't get your password.
               If you use a third-party client we recommend to use app passwords. You should also make sure, that no one else is able to install another Nextcloud
               instance on your host, because in this case he can overwrite your registration.</p>

               <img src='https://check.messaging.one/badge.php?domain=jsxc.org' alt='IM observatory score' /></a></p>

            <h4>Is this federated and what the hack is federated?</h4>
            <p>Federated means you are able to communicate with every other XMPP user if they support
               server-to-server communication. It's like E-Mail and yes, our XMPP server supports this.</p>

            <h4>Are there really no constraints?</h4>
            <p>Ok, you caught us. Our service doesn't work if you use E-Mail addresses as user ids in Nextcloud, but we are working on this.</p>
