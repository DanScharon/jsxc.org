After 14 month of hard work, we are extremly proud to announce the first public preview of JSXC 4.0. It's a total rewrite and brings
you long-awaited features like OMEMO, MUC invitation, voice call, JID escaping, experimental multi account support
and much more. The release is thought to collect feedback from administrators about APIs and the overall design. Please don't
use it in production yet!

This huge release will result in a lot of breaking changes, therefore we will explain you in the next sections how you can
install JSXC 4.0-alpha.1, which work has to be done until the stable release and which points are open for discussion. At the
end you find the preliminary change log and some screenshots.

## Installation
The installation is now a bit easier, but doesn't provide all options you know from JSXC 3.x. See the next 2 sections for details.

1. Download and extract the release archive to your web root.
2. Include the following files to your page:
   - `styles/jsxc.bundle.css`
   - `jsxc.bundle.js`
   - JQuery (3.x)
3. If you like to use OMEMO, download [libsignal] and include `dist/libsignal-protocol.js`.
4. Initialize JSXC with `jsxc.init()` and use either `jsxc.start()` or `jsxc.watchForm()`.

### Public API
Our new API is now much cleaner and encapsulated. This means you can't call internal functions, like done before. Currently
we provide the following functions:

#### jsxc.init
Like before, you have to initialize JSXC with some options in order to use the application.

```
init(options: Options)

interface Options {
  /** name of container application (e.g. Nextcloud or SOGo) */
  app_name = 'web applications';

  /** Default language */
  defaultLang = 'en';

  /** Place for roster */
  rosterAppend = 'body';

  RTCPeerConfig = {
     /** Time-to-live for config from url */
     ttl: 3600,

     /** ICE servers like defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#idl-def-RTCIceServer */
     iceServers: [{
        urls: 'stun:stun.stunprotocol.org'
     }]
  };

  onlineHelp = 'http://www.jsxc.org/manual.html';

  disabledPlugins: Array<string> = [];

  connectionCallback: (jid: string, status: number, condition?: string) => void = null;

  /** If the user requests to go online again, this function is called. Default: The login dialog is shown. */
  onUserRequestsToGoOnline: () => void = loginDialog;

  /** If user tries to login with login dialog, this value is used as BOSH url. */
  xmppBoshUrl: string = undefined;
}
```

#### jsxc.start
Start JSXC with either credentials from a prebind session, Jabber Id and password or just the UI.

```
start(boshUrl: string, jid: string, sid: string, rid: string);
start(boshUrl: string, jid: string, password: string);
start();
```

#### jsxc.enableDebugMode
Enable debug mode for more log messages.

```
enableDebugMode()
```

#### More
You find more APIs in `src/api/`. We will update the list above in the next few weeks.

## Pending work
Although we accomplished a lot in the last month, we still have some work to do. The following list is ordered from the most important to the nice-to-have features.

- Options: In JSXC 4.0 we aim to provide a lightweight API which fits most use cases. We know that there are currently some options missing compared to the 3.x branch, and we are working hard to bring most of them back to you. If you need something special or just want to drop your 2 cents, please look at the next section.
- Accessibility: Improve accessibility for people with screen reader or keyboard use.
- Bookmarks: Bookmark support should be back until the final release.
- Avatar upload: Update avatar inside JSXC. See [#304](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/issues/304)
- OMEMO ignore keys: It would be desirable if users could choose to ignore some OMEMO keys.
- System message icons: In 3.x system messages with icons were possible.
- Last message corrections: [XEP-0308: Last Message Correction](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0308.html) would be nice to have.

## Discussion
The current public API is mainly available directly under the `jsxc` namespace and can be called in any order. This means people can call `jsxc.start` before they call `jsxc.init` which is obviously a bad idea. A more chain-based approach could help here. This means `jsxc.init` would return the API which can only be called after the init method. This could also be handy in a multi account setup, where you could get account specific APIs after calling some `jsxc.getAccount` method. What do you think? Please drop your 2 cents at [TODO].
