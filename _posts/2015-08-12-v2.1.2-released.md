We are happy to announce the release of JSXC 2.1.2. You might wonder why we skipped the announcement of version 2.1.1, 
but shortly after the release we detected that an issue was not correctly solved. So we decided to wait for the announcement 
until everything is fixed.

The releases contain some important compatibility improvements for IE, safari and older versions of chrome, ff.

You find the core and owncloud download on [github](https://github.com/jsxc/) or on the right side of this page. Builds for SOGo and Ilias are coming soon.

## Core

### Bug fixes

- update grunt-sass (fix invalid css)
- update strophe.jingle (fix login with safari and older versions of ie, ff, chrome)
- update favico.js
- fix undefined error variable in ie
- fix handling of escaped jids (e.g. used in transports)
- fix placeholder replacement


### Developer changes

- add option for custom online user manual


## Owncloud

- handle escaped jids in loadAvatar
- fix TURN-REST-API credential generation



Thanks to everybody who contributed!
