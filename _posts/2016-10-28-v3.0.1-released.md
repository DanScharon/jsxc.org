Today we announce the first bug fix release of [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/), [jsxc.sogo](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc.sogo/releases) and [jsxc.owncloud](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/releases/) 3.0.

In this release we mainly improved multi-tab support and fixed some login issues in the Owncloud/Nexcloud version. As you may noticed the Ilias support is dropped because of too little interest. On the other hand this is the first release which supports SOGo v3. Compared to the last beta, this release fixes a MUC configuration and multiple UI issues in the SOGo v3 version.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to JSXC and keep up the good work, because the next feature release will contain some [awesome stuff](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/milestone/8)!
