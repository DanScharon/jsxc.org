A couple of days ago we released the first beta of [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/) and [jsxc.nextcloud](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc.nextcloud/releases/) 3.3.0 beta 1.

This release will enhance JSXC with automatic reconnection, external service discovery for ICE server information and some beneficial bug fixes. The Nextcloud version will integrate tighter with Nextcloud by adding chat information to the contact menu and significant improvements of the internal server. We are also proud to announce that we offer you free [XMPP hosting](https://www.jsxc.org/managed.html) for small Nextcloud installations. You like to run your own XMPP server and use your existing Nextcloud user management? Look at [XMPP cloud auth](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/) for Prosody and Ejabberd. We also published a [Prosody module](https://github.com/jsxc/prosody-cloud-roster) to extend your roster with your Nextcloud group contacts.

We would love if you could test this release and all other projects in the JSXC universe. If you find any inconvenience, please report this to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/issues) and if you have time, translate missing segments on [webtranslateit](https://webtranslateit.com/en/projects/10365-JSXC/project_locales).

Thanks to everyone who contributed. Specially to Yoshi, who translated JSXC into Japanese.
