title: XMPP-Cloud-Auth v1.1.0 pushes Nextcloud as an Authentication Hub
---

Today's minor release of [xmpp-cloud-auth](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/releases/) marks the conclusion of several months of work. 

## Nextcloud as an Authentication Hub

The list of changes below may look small, but they boost `xmpp-cloud-auth` to **a full-fledged authentication solution centered around [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com).**

As an admin, you now can manage all your user accounts in the comfortable Nextcloud user administrator. These accounts can the be made available as an authentication and user existence backend to
- an XMPP server such as [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im) or [Prosody](https://prosody.im) using the `ejabberd` and `prosody` authentication modes. This was the original goal when we started this project about 1Â½ years and over 300 commits ago.
- a POP3/IMAP server such as [Cyrus IMAP](https://cyrusimap.org) using the `saslauth` authentication mode. This replaces the real *saslauthd* and its user base with a compatible interface and the Nextcloud accounts.
- a SMTP server such as [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org) to
  * authenticate the users, again using the `saslauth` interface, and
  * identify the existence of virtual mailboxes using the `postfix` interface (`tcp_table` in Postfix lingo).

## A powerful solution

As security measures, both Nextcloud application-specific passwords and JSXC time-limited tokens are available for all authentication modes to avoid having to give out the account password to backend services. The time-limited tokens are especially helpful, as they allow single-sign-on mechanisms to work with backends that do require passwords and (for all authentication mechanisms) obviate the need to store the password in the web browser.

The new *systemd* socket activation mode is also much more resource-saving than previous modes, as only threads are created, not new processes, when handling new connections.

Thanks to everyone who contributed, also with helpful bug reports and recommendations.
