We are really proud to announce [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/) and [jsxc.owncloud](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/releases/) 3.0 after 2 beta releases and 7 months after 2.1.

- *Responsive Design:* The most visible change is the new *responsive design*, which we could implement with the help of [Jan](https://github.com/jancborchardt) at the ownCloud Contributor Conference.
- *Internal XMPP Server:* In Berlin, we also started a (historical) cooperation with [Tobia](https://github.com/LEDfan), the developer of ownCloud's chat app. We decided to merge our projects. During the past few months, he developed a chat server in PHP, included with the jsxc.owncloud app. Even if the chat server doesn't contain yet all features of a real XMPP server, it is a huge step for ownCloud and JSXC, as it allows JSXC to work out of the box in ownCloud.
- *Repository Move:* For this occasion we move the jsxc.owncloud repository into the ownCloud organisation and is now available via [owncloud/jsxc.chat](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/).
- *File Transfer:* As another innovation, we present an often requested feature: File transfers via WebRTC.

We would like to thank everyone who contributed with code, translations, bug reports, and design/UI/UX advice. It is amazing to have such a great community after 2 years of continuous work! We are looking forward to the next years. If you want to join, please have a look at our [contributor guide](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/wiki/Contributor-Guide).
