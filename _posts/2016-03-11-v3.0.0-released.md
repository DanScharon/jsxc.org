We are really proud to announce [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/) and [jsxc.owncloud](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/releases/) 3.0 after 2 beta releases and 7 month after 2.1.

The most visible change is the new responsive design, which we could implement with the help of [Jan](https://github.com/jancborchardt) at the Owncloud Contributor Conference. In Berlin we also started a (historical) cooperation with [Tobia](https://github.com/LEDfan) the developer of Owncloud's chat app. We decided to merge our projects and that he develops a XMPP-like PHP server for internal chats. Even if it doesn't contain yet all features of a real XMPP server, it is a huge step for Owncloud and JSXC. For this occasion we move the jsxc.owncloud repository into the Owncloud organisation and is now available via [owncloud/jsxc.chat](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/). As third innovation we present a often requested feature: File transfers via WebRTC.

You are looking for the updated versions of SOGo and Ilias? Please be patient, we are working hard on them. You find first preview screenshot on our front page.

We would like to thank all who contributed with code, translations or bug reports. It is amazing to have such a great community after 2 years of continuous work. We are looking forward to the next years. If you want to join, please have a look at our [contributor guide](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/wiki/Contributor-Guide).
