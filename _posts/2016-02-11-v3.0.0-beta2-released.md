Today we release the second beta of [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/) and 
[jsxc.owncloud](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/releases/) 3.0..

Compared to the first beta we did a lot of clean up and style/usability fixes. Especially 
the multi-user chat needed some love. Our Owncloud internal server backend supports now
presence information and we set the minimum required Owncloud version to 8.0.

For a detailed view about all changes look at the changelog below and for screenshots checkout 
our post to [v3.0.0-beta1](https://www.jsxc.org/blog/2016/01/28/v3.0.0-beta1-released/).

Now we just have to give this beta a good test, update all screenshots on our homepage and
update our plugins for Ilias and SOGo. If you have some time, please translate missing
segments on [webtranslateit](translateit.com/en/projects/10365-JSXC).
