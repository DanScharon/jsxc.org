We are announcing the release of JSXC 2.1.4. As last time we had to skip the announcement of one bug fix release, because shortly after building it we got a report about a showstopper bug.

The releases contain fixes for older versions of ie, minor usability improvements and fixes for the bookmark feature.

As usual you find the core and owncloud download on [github](https://github.com/jsxc/) or on the right side of this page. Builds for SOGo and Ilias are coming soon.

## Core

### Bug fixes

- fix bookmark loading
- show unread notifications only if the chat window has no focus
- remove leading at sign from comments in build file (fix ie)

## Owncloud

- disable jsxc if core or dependencies threw an error



Thanks to everybody who contributed!
