We are proud to announce the release of [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/) and [jsxc.nextcloud](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc.nextcloud/releases/) 3.3.0.

This release will enhance JSXC with automatic reconnection, external service discovery for ICE server information and some beneficial bug fixes. The Nextcloud version will integrate tighter with Nextcloud by adding chat information to the contact menu and significant improvements of the internal server. We are also proud to announce that we offer you free [XMPP hosting](https://www.jsxc.org/managed.html) for small Nextcloud installations. You like to run your own XMPP server and use your existing Nextcloud user management? Look at [XMPP cloud auth](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/) for Prosody and Ejabberd. We also published a [Prosody module](https://github.com/jsxc/prosody-cloud-roster) to extend your roster with your Nextcloud group contacts.

Thanks to everyone who contributed and tested the beta releases. Specially to Yoshi, who translated JSXC into Japanese.
