We are really proud to announce [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1) and [jsxc.owncloud](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1) 3.0.0 beta1. It is the release with the biggest changes 
and most contributors since we started in 2013.

The most visible change is the new responsive design, which we could implement with the help of [Jan](https://github.com/jancborchardt) at the Owncloud Contributor Conference. In Berlin we also started a (historical) cooperation with [Tobia](https://github.com/LEDfan) the developer of Owncloud's chat app. We decided to merge our projects and that he develops a XMPP-like PHP server for internal chats. Even if it doesn't contain yet all features of a real XMPP server, it is a huge step for Owncloud and JSXC. For this occasion we move the jsxc.owncloud repository into the Owncloud organisation and is now available via [owncloud/jsxc.chat](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/). As third innovation we present a often requested feature: File transfers via WebRTC.

Thanks a lot to everyone who contributed with pull requests, testing, bug reporting, translating and their opinion. Please give this release a really good test, so that we can release the greatest build since the invention of JSXC in about 2-3 weeks.
