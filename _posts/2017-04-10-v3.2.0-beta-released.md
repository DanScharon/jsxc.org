A couple of days ago we released the first beta of [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/) and [jsxc.nextcloud](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc.nextcloud/releases/) 3.2.0 beta 1.

This feature release will fix a lot of bugs and bring the long awaited [Message Archive Management (XEP-0313)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) to retrieve conversations from your XMPP server. To activate this enhancement you have to set [man.enable = true](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/blob/6687eaa66c98d6b4e03b4ddd778ae85d590b946f/src/jsxc.lib.options.js#L310) or enable MAM in your personal JSXC settings (bottom right gear > Settings). In parallel we developed a [XMPP-\*Cloud-Authentication module](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth) for Ejabberd/Prosody which allows you to use your \*Cloud as authentication backend. To get rid of password retyping in the future, we already implemented what we call time-limited tokens. Those tokens can be generated from every trusted server and can be used as password, but only for an defined time. More on this topic at relevant time.

As usual, give this beta release a really good test and report bugs to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/issues) and translate missing segments on [webtranslateit](https://webtranslateit.com/en/projects/10365-JSXC/project_locales).

Thanks to everyone who contributed. <img src="/build/img/emotions/klaus.svg" alt="Klaus" style="width:1.5em;height:1.5em;" /> <img src="/build/lib/emojione/assets/svg/1f44d.svg" alt="thumbs up" style="width:1.5em;height:1.5em;" />
