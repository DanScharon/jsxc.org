Today we release the second beta of [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/), [jsxc.sogo](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc.sogo/releases) and [jsxc.owncloud](https://github.com/owncloud/jsxc.chat/releases/) 3.0.1. (The first beta was unannounced)

After some quite time this is the first bug fix release for the 3.0 branch. Beside some important bug fixes we mainly improved multi-tab support. As you may noticed the Ilias support is dropped because of too little interest. On the other hand this is the first release which supports SOGo v3.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to JSXC and keep up the good work, because the next feature release will contain some [awesome stuff](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/milestone/8)!
