Today we are proud to announce the final release of [jsxc](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/) and [jsxc.nextcloud](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc.nextcloud/releases/) 3.2.0. (Releases for SOGo and Owncloud will follow)

After a lot of testing, this feature release will fix a lot of bugs and bring the long awaited [Message Archive Management (XEP-0313)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) to retrieve conversations from your XMPP server. To activate this enhancement you have to set [man.enable = true](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/blob/6687eaa66c98d6b4e03b4ddd778ae85d590b946f/src/jsxc.lib.options.js#L310) or enable MAM in your personal JSXC settings (bottom right gear > Settings). In parallel we developed a [XMPP-\*Cloud-Authentication module](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth) for Ejabberd/Prosody which allows you to use your \*Cloud as authentication backend. To get rid of password retyping in the future, we already implemented what we call time-limited tokens. Those tokens can be generated from every trusted server and can be used as password, but only for an defined time. More on this topic at relevant time.

Thanks to everyone who contributed. <img src="/build/img/emotions/klaus.svg" alt="Klaus" style="width:1.5em;height:1.5em;" /> <img src="/build/lib/emojione/assets/svg/1f44d.svg" alt="thumbs up" style="width:1.5em;height:1.5em;" />

What's up next? Currently we are working on a rewrite of JSXC to create a stable bases for further improvements. This next big release will be written in Typescript and contain a complete new API with a lot of new cool feature, like multi Account support or OMEMO.
