We are happy to announce the release of version 2.0.2 of our *XMPP Cloud Authentication* `xcauth`.

Based on the feedback from the
[excellent workshop with excited and exciting participants](https://twitter.com/Nextclouders/status/1033721300223766528)
at [Nextcloud Conference 2018](https://nextcloud.com/conf),
we made the installation and setup even more comfortable and complete.

## Shared Roster Groups

When using `xcauth` with *ejabberd*, activating *Shared Roster Groups* requires just the deletion of a single comment character.
*Shared Roster Groups* make *JSXC* and *XMPP* much more user-friendly: You will automatically have all the users in your groups visible
in your roster. This greatly simplifies getting started.

Enjoy!

## Installation

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/releases/latest) or use the `.deb` package repository at `https://dl.jsxc.org/` (`stable` or `nightly`).

When setting up a new server, just follow our
[Debian and/or Raspberry Pi setup documentation](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/wiki/raspberry-pi-en),
[also available in German](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/wiki/raspberry-pi).

## Changes in v2.0.2
### Added
- Have a valid default `type=` in `/etc/xcauth.conf` to reduce required
  configuration steps
- `xcrestart` stops `xcauth.service` as well before restarting the sockets
- `xcrestart` tries to fix permission problems
  (`xcauth` is sometimes manually before it as a test, creating DB and log
  with the wrong user ID)
- `xcrestart` is more verbose on what it does,
  as a weak replacement for a man page
- Support for running `ejabberdctl` through `sudo`
  (to allow user `xcauth` to modify the shared roster related stuff)
- *Prosody* modules are installed "almost ready" in `/usr/lib/prosody/modules`
  (`pseudolpty.lua` ready for action, our `mod_auth_external.lua` as
  `*-xcauth-version` as not to interfere with *Prosody*'s version.
  To activate it, the admin needs to rename it.
- *ejabberd* example configuration files from our
  [Debian setup, not only for the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/wiki/raspberry-pi-en)
  are now installed as `/etc/ejabberd/*-xcauth-example` to simplify
  the installation.

### Fixed
- Changed permissions for `/var/log/xcauth` (`logrotate` would refuse to work on it)
- Add dependency on `python3-bsddb3` and `pyton3-systemd`

### Changed
- Obsoleted `install.sh`
