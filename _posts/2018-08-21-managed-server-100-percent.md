title: XMPP Managed Server achieves 100% compliance
---
The restless guys behind [*Conversations*](https://conversations.im) together with [Rishi Raj](https://rishiraj.me/) released an
[online and extended version of their *XMPP Compliance Tester*](https://compliance.conversations.im).

We are proud to announce that we upgraded our [Managed Server](/managed.html) in the past 24 hours to achieve 100% compatibility:

As a service to the community, we have also updated our *easy-XMPP-setup* documentation to automatically create a compatible setup.
So, from the start, you have a modern setup, which will make it easier to communicate for your users to communicate among each other
and with users in the whole global XMPP federation.
